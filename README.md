## MA703_FinalReport  
This repository is for **Dynamical spreading over the face-to-face contact network**.  

### Data files:  
Data, data all and graphdata contains the combined original contact data in different data type.

InfectedNumber is the simulated results for model 1, InfectedNumber_E is the simulated results for model 2, and InfectedNumber_E2 is the simulated results for model 3.

### Coding files:
There are three modeling r scripts. The simulation results are running by scc so there are three readin data r scripts, to readin original data and simulation results.

The DataProcessing_EDA script comtains the main analysis process, with all codes for plots.
